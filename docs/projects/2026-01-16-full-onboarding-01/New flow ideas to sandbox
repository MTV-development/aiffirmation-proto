tz-01
Her er mit oplæg til nyt flow - jeg har tænkt det ind i onboaridng med det samme.

# New flow – warm & short - containing full onboarding 
## Step 0: 
**Headline:** The way you speak to yourself becomes the way you live. 🌿🌸  

CTA: Continue


## Step 1: First name
**Headline:** What should we call you? 🌸  
**Placeholder:** Type your first name

CTA: Continue

## Step 2: Welcome
**Text:** Welcome, {name} 💛

## Step 4: Before swipe (explain the logic)
**Headline:** Thank you, {name} — let’s shape this together 💛  
**Text:** Next, we’ll show affirmations based on what you shared.  
You’ll see them one by one.  
Swipe **down (toward you)** to **keep** it.  
Swipe **up (away)** if it doesn’t feel right.  
Your swipes help us tailor the next ones to you.


CTA: Start

NOTE: Jeg har valgt swipe op/ned, fordi jeg ikke selv kan huske, hvad swipe højre/venstre betyder (hvad er hvad?). Jeg har prøvet op/ned i en anden app, og det gav god mening for mig: mod mig = det vil jeg gerne have, væk fra mig = det vil jeg ikke have. Vi kan sagtens bruge højre/venstre i stedet


---

## Step 5: Swipe (e.g., 10 affirmations)
**Small label:** Swipe for next
We migh need some action 'succesfully saved' + 'discared' so user can see some sort of reassurance
Show counter affirmation 1 out of 10.
