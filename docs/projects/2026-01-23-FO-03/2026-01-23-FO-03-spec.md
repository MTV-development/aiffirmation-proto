# FO-03 Specification

**Created:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready

## Overview

FO-03 introduces a **gradual, multi-question onboarding flow** that:
1. Warms users up with easy questions before asking for longer input
2. Uses toggleable inspiration chips alongside open text fields to reduce friction
3. Collects more context (feelings, situation, what helps) for better affirmations
4. Makes list-building explicit during swiping
5. Provides clearer ending with guidance on using affirmations

## Scope & Decisions

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Scope | Full flow (all 13 steps) |
| "Not sure" behavior | Skip step entirely (no input sent) |
| AO-01 (LLM questions) | Separate future work |
| Chip behavior | Toggle selection (can select multiple alongside typed text) |
| Swipe phase | Similar to FO-02 iterative approach with better messaging |
| Animations | In scope (confetti, heart animations) |
| Background selection | UI mockup only |
| Notifications | UI mockup only |
| Paywall | UI mockup only |
| Final destination | Affirmation list view |

## Swipe Phase

### First Affirmation
**Intro message:** "Save this affirmation if it feels right — or discard it if it doesn't. You are forming your personal list now."

### After First Action
**Feedback:** "Keep going {name} - every time you like or dislike an affirmation we prepare even better affirmations for you."

### Swipe Mechanics
- Similar to FO-02 iterative batch generation
- Swipe right to save, left to discard
- System refines next batch based on feedback

### Step 8: After 10 Affirmations (Checkpoint)
**Headline:** Perfect, {name}!
**Text:** The ones you liked are now on your personal affirmation list. Let's add more, so you have a full personal list that fits you.
**CTA:** Continue / "I'm good with the affirmations I chose"

### Step 9: More Rounds (Optional)
If user chooses to continue:
- Swipe another batch
- **Checkpoint after batch:** "Great job, {name}! Your list is getting stronger and more personal. Would you like to add a few more affirmations?"
- **CTA:** Yes, please / No, continue

### Transition to Finishing
**Text:** "Perfect, {name}! You now have a strong list of personal affirmations. Next, let's make them feel even more you with a beautiful background."
**CTA:** Continue

## Post-Swipe Flow

### Step 10: Background Selection (UI Mockup)
**Headline:** Make your affirmations look beautiful
**Text:** Choose a background for your affirmations — you can always explore more later.
**UI:** Grid of background options (selection works but doesn't persist)
**CTA:** Continue

### Step 11: Notifications (UI Mockup)
**Headline:** Set up reminders with your personal affirmations
**Text:** Affirmations work best when they gently meet you again and again.
**Question:** How many times a day would you like one sent to you?
**UI:** Frequency selector (non-functional)
**CTA:** Continue

### Step 12: Light Paywall (UI Mockup)
**Headline:** More support, whenever you want
**Text:** Get 3 days free of premium. With Premium, you can create hundreds of lists and expand your personal list with 100s of affirmations.
**CTA:** Try free for 3 days (proceeds) / Not now (proceeds)

### Step 13: Finish
**Headline:** You're all set, {name} - this is your list!
**CTA:** See my affirmations → navigates to **Affirmation List View**

## Data Model

User input collected during onboarding:
```typescript
interface FO03OnboardingData {
  name: string;
  familiarity: 'new' | 'some' | 'very';
  topics: string[];           // Selected topic chips
  situation: {
    text: string;             // Free text input
    chips: string[];          // Selected chips
  };
  feelings: {
    text: string;
    chips: string[];
  };
  whatHelps: {
    text: string;
    chips: string[];
  };
}
```

All fields except `name` can be empty/skipped.

## LLM Integration

The onboarding data is passed to the affirmation generation prompt. The LLM receives:
- User's name
- Experience level with affirmations
- Selected topics of interest
- Situation context (chips + free text)
- Current feelings (chips + free text)
- What helps them feel good (chips + free text)

This richer context should produce more personalized affirmations compared to FO-01's single text input.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Exact animation implementations (confetti library, heart animation style)
- [ ] How many background options to show in the mockup?
- [ ] Notification frequency options to display?

## Future Work

- **AO-01:** LLM-driven conversational onboarding (dynamic questions instead of fixed screens)
