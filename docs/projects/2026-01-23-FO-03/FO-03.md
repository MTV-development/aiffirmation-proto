# FO-01 Onboarding Flow — Structured Feedback (EN, updated)

## Overall feeling
- The flow asks me to **write a lot right away**, and the quality of the affirmations suddenly depends almost entirely on that one input.  
  → This lowers the “success rate” because many users won’t know what to write (or won’t write enough).

- At the same time, being asked to **write only one thing** makes it feel like the process ends too quickly.  
  → I want the onboarding to ask **more questions** and feel **more gradual**, so personalization doesn’t depend on one big moment.

- Because the process is short, I only realize later (when the affirmations start appearing) that I “should have written much more.”  
  → That creates regret: *“Ah, I should have written way more in my answer.”*

---

## Key balance we need to hit (important nuance)
- I **do not** want to remove the option to write a lot — long writing can produce amazing results.  
- I just don’t want **heavy free-writing to be the very first thing** the user is asked to do.  
- At the same time: when the flow previously leaned more toward **predefined selections** (and free-writing felt less central), it didn’t feel **unique or extremely personal**.  
→ We need something in between:
  - Start gently with guidance/inspiration + small prompts
  - Keep the door open for deeper free-writing once the user feels safe and "warmed up"

---

## Make the onboarding feel unique (more "eureka" + healing)

- Suggestion to go beyond "What do you want help with?"

- Add more personal, reflective questions so onboarding itself feels healing / makes the user feel heard (this includes what do you hope affirmations will do for you?)

- Examples of prompts:
  - "What's going on in your life right now?"
  - "How are you feeling today?"
  - "What would you like to feel more of?"

- Why it matters: more human/caring, stronger emotional connection, clearer eureka moment, more personal affirmations without forcing long writing immediately

---

## Clarity: "List building" is not obvious
- It’s unclear to me that I’m actively **building my personal list** during the swipe part.
- I would like to know upfront that:
  - “We’re building your personal affirmation list as you go.”
  - “We’ll save the best ones for you.”

---

## What works really well
- The **final list overview** feels great.
  - Seeing the list I created gives a strong “this is mine” feeling.
  - The overview makes the affirmations feel personal and real.

- The **first 3 steps** are generally good.
  - I like the question: **“What do you hope affirmations can help you with, Trine?”**

---

## What I would change / improve

### 1) Don’t lead with “write a lot”
- I want a more gradual start with **multiple prompts**, and then the option to go deeper.
- The user should be able to:
  - answer small questions quickly, and/or
  - expand into longer writing when they feel ready.

### 2) Add more prompts
- Add a few short, guided questions to increase personalization without pressure.
- Make room  for longer writing.

### 3) Combine “I don’t know” with the writing step
- Consider merging the “I don’t know” inspiration screen with the open input screen:
  - Let me choose topics for inspiration *and/or* write freely on the same screen.
  - This reduces friction and helps users who don’t know what to write.

### 4) The swipe instruction screen is too text-heavy
- The screen that explains swiping is **too informative / too much text**.
- I’d prefer:
  - shorter microcopy, and
  - more “show, don’t tell” (visual guidance / first-card tutorial).

### 5) Add a “second round” personalization moment after initial swipes
After I’ve swiped a handful of affirmations, I want a choice like:

- **Option A:** “Want more like the ones you kept?” (continue swiping based on preferences)  
- **Option B:** “Want to share a bit more?” (answer one more question for deeper personalization)

### 6) Time = attachment (and that’s good)
- The longer I spend shaping my list (within onboarding), the more attached I become to it.
- More interaction = stronger feeling of ownership and meaning.

---

## Ending / “What do I do now?”
- The flow needs a stronger ending that answers:
  - “Now that I’ve created my list — how should I use it?”
  - How often should I read them?
  - What’s a simple daily routine?

---

## Ratings / Favorites behavior (precision)
- The rating prompt is triggered after **6 favorites**.
- If users don’t naturally tap **Favorites** during/after onboarding, they may never reach the rating trigger.  
  → Lower ratings (or fewer ratings) can be a consequence of users not favoriting enough items early on.

# new onboarding

questions that will lead to Succesful affirmations
**“What do you hope affirmations can help you with, Trine?”**

- Examples of prompts:
  - "What's going on in your life right now?"
  - "How are you feeling today?"
  - "What would you like to feel more of?"

What does user need help with:
“What made you decide to reach out right now?” /“What would feel most helpful to talk about today?” / what do you hope affirmations can do for you?


What going on in users life right now:
“What’s been happening in your life lately?” / “What feels heavy, stuck, or stressful right now?” / “What’s been taking up most space in your mind these days?”

Goals and hopes (very important for direction)
“What would you like to feel more of?”
“Is there anything from your background that feels relevant to this?”


Quick “choose one” micro-prompts (perfect for an app)
“Right now I feel most: tired / anxious / sad / numb / restless / hopeful / overwhelmed.”

“Today I need more: calm / clarity / confidence / self-kindness / motivation / grounding.”

....
“How are you arriving today—what are you feeling right now?”
“What’s been going on lately that brought you here?”
“What would you like to feel more of?”

#AO-01 - Agent Onboarding -> New onboarding wit LLM creating the questions

<!-- DEV NOTE: Morten i virkelighedn vil jeg gerne afprøve at få lidt a la onboardingen ovenfor men lade agenten stille spørgsmålene - jeg er kommet med et brud på et prompt men jeg er egnetlig lidt i tvivl hvad der er smartes fx. lav de første 4 skærme og derfeter begynder LLM'en at stille spørgsmål - lad os lige drøfte. Det smarte er hvis vi kan få den til at stille de spørgsmål der giver bedst affirmations jo -->

You are a warm, emotionally intelligent guide helping a user create personal, believable affirmations.

Your task is to lead a short onboarding conversation that gathers enough insight to create affirmations that feel safe, realistic, and personal.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Ask a maximum of 6 questions total.
- Ask ONE question at a time.
- Start with very easy, low-effort questions.
- Gradually move slightly deeper, but never heavy or clinical.
- Prefer questions that can be answered briefly.
- Whenever possible, provide optional examples or selectable suggestions.
- Always reassure the user that short answers or “I don’t know” are okay.
- Never pressure the user to write more.
- Do NOT analyze, diagnose, or give advice.
- Do NOT generate affirmations until all questions are complete.

TONE & STYLE:
- Warm, friendly, human.
- Like a caring friend checking in.
- Simple language, no therapy jargon.
- Use the user’s name occasionally.
- Encourage gently, never push.

GOAL:
By the end of the questions, you should understand:
- what the user wants support with
- how they feel right now
- what’s happening in their life
- what kind of support/tone feels right
- what already helps them feel a little better

When you have enough information, stop asking questions and say:
“Thank you — I’m ready to create affirmations that fit you.”
