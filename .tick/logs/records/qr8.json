  "output": "I'll start by reading the relevant files to understand the current implementation and then wire up Steps 5-7.\n\nNow I understand the structure. I need to:\n1. Import `TextWithChips` and `HeartAnimation` components\n2. Implement Steps 5-7 using the chip data from the spec\n3. Add intermediate transition states for heart animations between steps\n\nThe tricky part is handling the heart animation transitions. I'll need to add intermediate states (5.5 and 6.5) for the heart animations, or use a different approach. Looking at the existing pattern in `step-familiarity.tsx`, I'll implement sub-steps within the case statement.\n\nLet me update the `fo-experience.tsx` file:\n\nNow I need to add the chip data constants and update the step rendering. Let me add the chip data after the imports and before the interfaces:\n\nNow I need to update the state to include sub-steps for heart animations. I'll add a `showHeartAnimation` boolean to track whether to show the heart animation for the current step:\n\nI'll add a `showHeartAnimation` boolean to track the heart animation state. Let me update the OnboardingState interface and initial state:\n\nNow let me update the step 5, 6, and 7 case statements to use the new components. First, let me read the current switch statement section:\n\nNow I'll update the case statements for steps 5, 6, and 7. The logic for heart animations:\n- Step 5: Show TextWithChips for situation, on Continue -\u003e show heart animation -\u003e advance to step 6\n- Step 6: Show TextWithChips for feelings, on Continue -\u003e show heart animation -\u003e advance to step 7\n- Step 7: Show TextWithChips for whatHelps, on Continue -\u003e advance to step 8 (no heart animation)\n\nNow let me verify the changes by reading the updated file:\n\nThe implementation looks correct. Now let me run the build to check for any TypeScript errors:\n\nThe build command seems to produce no output. Let me try running lint to verify there are no issues:\n\nLet me try a direct tsc check:\n\nThe TypeScript check passes with no errors. Let me also verify the linting passes:\n\nAll checks pass. Now let me update the todo list and close the task:\n\nNow let me close the task with a summary:\n\nNow let me commit the changes:\n\nNow let me add an epic note for future iterations:\n\nI've completed the task. Here's a summary of what was done:\n\n**Task [qr8] Implement Steps 5-7 using TextWithChips and HeartAnimation - Completed**\n\n**Changes made to `app/fo-03/components/fo-experience.tsx`:**\n\n1. **Added imports** for `TextWithChips` and `HeartAnimation` components\n\n2. **Added chip data constants** for all three steps:\n   - `SITUATION_PRIMARY_CHIPS` / `SITUATION_MORE_CHIPS` (Step 5)\n   - `FEELINGS_PRIMARY_CHIPS` / `FEELINGS_MORE_CHIPS` (Step 6)\n   - `WHAT_HELPS_PRIMARY_CHIPS` / `WHAT_HELPS_MORE_CHIPS` (Step 7)\n\n3. **Added `showHeartAnimation` state** to `OnboardingState` interface and `initialState` to control transition animations between steps\n\n4. **Wired up Step 5 (Situation)**:\n   - Headline: \"What has been going on lately that brought you here, {name}?\"\n   - Shows heart animation with \"You are doing great - the more you write the better affirmations!\" after Continue\n   - \"Not sure\" skips directly to Step 6\n\n5. **Wired up Step 6 (Feelings)**:\n   - Headline: \"What are you feeling right now?\"\n   - Shows heart animation with personalized message after Continue\n   - \"Not sure\" skips directly to Step 7\n\n6. **Wired up Step 7 (What helps)**:\n   - Headline: \"What normally makes you feel good?\"\n   - No heart animation after (proceeds directly to Step 8)\n   - \"Not sure\" skips to Step 8",
