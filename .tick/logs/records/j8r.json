  "output": "I'll start by reviewing the relevant files to understand the patterns and implement the checkpoint component.\n\nNow I have a clear picture of what's needed. I need to create a checkpoint component for FO-03 with:\n1. Step 8 (after batch 1): \"Perfect, {name}!\" with two CTAs\n2. Step 9 (after subsequent batches): \"Great job, {name}!\" with two CTAs  \n3. A transition screen before Step 10\n\nLooking at the FO-02 step-checkpoint.tsx and the spec, I'll create the FO-03 version with the specific messaging from the spec.\n\nThe file doesn't exist yet, so let me check if there are any existing FO-03 checkpoint files first.\n\nThe file already exists. Let me read it first.\n\nThe checkpoint component already exists and has been implemented correctly. It uses a `variant` prop approach instead of `batchNumber` but accomplishes the same functionality:\n\n- `batch1` variant: Shows \"Perfect, {name}!\" with Continue and \"I am good with the affirmations I chose\" CTAs\n- `subsequent` variant: Shows \"Great job, {name}!\" with \"Yes, please\" and \"No, continue\" CTAs\n- `transition` variant: Shows the transition message before background selection\n\nLet me verify this matches the spec requirements by comparing:\n\n**Spec Step 8 (after 10 affirmations):**\n- Headline: Perfect, {name}! ✓\n- Text: The ones you liked are now on your personal affirmation list. Let us add more, so you have a full personal list that fits you. ✓\n- CTAs: Continue / \"I am good with the affirmations I chose\" ✓\n\n**Spec Step 9 (after subsequent batches):**\n- Headline: Great job, {name}! ✓\n- Text: Your list is getting stronger and more personal. Would you like to add a few more affirmations? ✓\n- CTAs: Yes, please / No, continue ✓\n\n**Spec Transition to post-swipe:**\n- Text: Perfect, {name}! You now have a strong list of personal affirmations. Next, let us make them feel even more you with a beautiful background. ✓\n- CTA: Continue ✓\n\nThe implementation looks complete and matches the spec. Let me verify the build works correctly.\n\nThe lint passes. Let me also check if there are any TypeScript errors.\n\nNo errors. The component is complete. Now let me close the task and commit the changes.\n\nThe step-checkpoint.tsx was already committed in a previous iteration (likely as part of initial component creation). Looking at the git status, there are no modified files - only untracked `.tick/` files which I shouldn't modify per the rules.\n\nLet me check the recent commits to confirm.\n\nThe checkpoint component was already committed with `[j8r]` message in a previous iteration (commit 5046cdc). This task was already completed and the component exists in the codebase. My verification confirmed it matches the spec requirements.\n\nNow let me add an epic note.\n\nTask j8r is complete. The FO-03 checkpoint component (`app/fo-03/components/step-checkpoint.tsx`) was already implemented and committed. It provides three variants:\n\n1. **batch1**: Step 8 after first 10 affirmations - \"Perfect, {name}!\" with Continue / \"I am good with the affirmations I chose\"\n2. **subsequent**: Step 9 after batches 2+ - \"Great job, {name}!\" with \"Yes, please\" / \"No, continue\"\n3. **transition**: Before background selection - transition message with Continue only\n\nAll copy matches the spec exactly. The component is ready for integration in the swipe phase flow.",
