  "output": "I'll start by reading the current state of the fo-experience.tsx file to understand how the post-swipe screens are currently integrated and what needs to be done.\n\nBased on my review of the code, I can see that the post-swipe screens (Steps 10-13) are already fully wired up in fo-experience.tsx:\n\n- **Step 10 (line 572-573):** `\u003cStepBackground onContinue={nextStep} /\u003e`\n- **Step 11 (line 575-576):** `\u003cStepNotifications onContinue={nextStep} /\u003e`\n- **Step 12 (line 578-579):** `\u003cStepPaywall onContinue={nextStep} /\u003e`\n- **Step 13 (line 581-587):** `\u003cStepCompletion name={state.name} approvedAffirmations={state.approvedAffirmations} /\u003e`\n\nThe imports are also already in place (lines 12-15). The flow is properly set up:\n1. After swipe phase completion (batch checkpoints), `goToStep(10)` is called at line 482 and 538\n2. Each step advances via `nextStep()` on CTA click\n3. The final step (13) shows the affirmation list\n\nLet me verify all the component files exist and are properly implemented.\n\nAll the component files exist. Let me verify they're properly implemented by reading them to ensure the integration is correct.\n\nAll the post-swipe screen components are fully implemented and properly integrated into fo-experience.tsx. The integration is complete:\n\n1. **Step 10 (StepBackground):** Grid of 6 gradient backgrounds, selection highlights, \"Continue\" advances\n2. **Step 11 (StepNotifications):** 4 frequency options (1, 2, 3, 5 times daily per spec), selection highlights, \"Continue\" advances\n3. **Step 12 (StepPaywall):** Premium offer with \"Try free for 3 days\" and \"Not now\" buttons - both proceed\n4. **Step 13 (StepCompletion):** Shows user's name and displays all approved affirmations with empty state handling\n\nThe flow is properly wired:\n- After swipe phase checkpoints, `goToStep(10)` is called\n- Each step uses `nextStep()` to advance (Background→Notifications→Paywall→Completion)\n- Final step (13) displays the affirmation list directly\n\nLet me run the dev server and verify the complete flow works by checking if there are any TypeScript/lint errors.\n\nThe lint command completed without any output, which means there are no lint errors. Let me also verify the TypeScript compilation.\n\nBoth lint and TypeScript pass with no errors. The post-swipe screens are already fully wired up in fo-experience.tsx. \n\nBased on my analysis:\n- All four step components exist and are properly implemented\n- All imports are present in fo-experience.tsx\n- The case statements for steps 10-13 are properly rendering each component\n- The flow is correctly wired: after swipe completion → Step 10 → 11 → 12 → 13\n- Each component receives the correct props (`onContinue` for steps 10-12, `name` and `approvedAffirmations` for step 13)\n\nThe task has already been completed by previous iterations. Let me close the task and add a note.\n\nThe task is complete. The post-swipe screens were already fully wired up in fo-experience.tsx by previous iterations. I verified:\n\n1. **Imports present** (lines 12-15): StepBackground, StepNotifications, StepPaywall, StepCompletion\n2. **Case statements implemented** (lines 572-587): Each step renders the correct component with proper props\n3. **Flow correct**: After swipe phase completion, `goToStep(10)` is called, then `nextStep()` advances through Background → Notifications → Paywall → Completion\n4. **No errors**: TypeScript and ESLint pass with no issues\n\nSince no changes were needed, there's nothing to commit. The epic notes have been updated for future reference.",
