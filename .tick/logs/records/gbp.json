  "output": "I'll create the heart animation component for transition screens between Steps 5-\u003e6 and 6-\u003e7. Let me first review the existing components to understand the animation patterns used.\n\nNow let me check the spec for more details on the heart animation requirements.\n\nNow I have a good understanding of the requirements. Let me create the heart animation component. Based on the spec:\n- Step 5 → Heart animation with \"You are doing great - the more you write the better affirmations!\"\n- Step 6 → Heart animation with \"You have been doing great, {name}! We are creating your personalized affirmations.\"\n\nI'll create a reusable component with Framer Motion animations.\n\nNow let me verify the component by running lint to check for any issues.\n\nLint passed. Let me also verify the build works with TypeScript.\n\nTypeScript passes. Now let me close the task and commit the changes.\n\nTask completed. I created the `HeartAnimation` component at `app/fo-03/components/heart-animation.tsx` with:\n\n- **Props:** `message` (string) and `onComplete` (callback)\n- **Animation:** Pulsing heart SVG icon using Framer Motion with spring entrance and continuous scale animation\n- **Behavior:** Auto-advances after 2.5 seconds or on click\n- **Styling:** Matches existing components with purple color scheme and dark mode support\n\nThe component is ready to be wired into `fo-experience.tsx` for transitions between Steps 5→6 and 6→7.",
