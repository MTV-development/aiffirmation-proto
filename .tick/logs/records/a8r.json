  "output": "\n\nI'll start by understanding the current state of the project and the E2E test file, then run the test.\n\nLet me check if the dev server is running and look at the FO-09 components.\n\nThe dev server is running (returning 404 for `/fo-09` though — the page exists but may need checking). Let me read the main page component to understand the flow.\n\nGood, I have a solid understanding of the codebase. The dev server returned 404, which likely means the `/fo-09` route is not registered properly. Let me check the layout and navigation config.\n\nNav config is fine — FO-09 is registered. The 404 might be a transient issue. Let me try to actually run the E2E test. First, let me ensure the dev server is running properly.\n\nThe server root responds 200. Let me check the FO-09 page more carefully — it might return 200 with content that gets redirected client-side.\n\nGetting 404 on `/fo-09`. Let me check if the Next.js app is recognizing the route. This could be because the page wasn't built yet — the dev server may need a restart since these are new files.\n\nThe files exist. Let me check if the FO-09 layout client file exists and is properly set up.\n\nThe layout client looks fine. The 404 might be due to the dev server not having picked up the new route. Let me check if the dev server needs restarting.\n\nThat's a very minimal 404 — not a Next.js 404. This looks like the dev server may not be a Next.js dev server, or it might need restarting. Let me check what's running on port 3000.\n\nFO-08 is also 404. This isn't a Next.js dev server on port 3000 — something else is listening. Let me check what process it is.\n\nThat's a `tk.exe` process, not the Next.js dev server. I need to start the Next.js dev server. Let me check if it's running on a different port or needs to be started.\n\nBoth ports are tk processes. Let me search for any Next.js dev server running.\n\nAll three ports are tk processes. No Next.js dev server is running. I need to start it. Since port 3000 is occupied, I'll start it on a different port or need to use the port the test expects. The test defaults to `localhost:3000`. Let me start the dev server on a free port and set `TEST_URL`.\n\nThe dev server didn't start. Let me try more directly.\n\nThe process completed immediately. Let me check the output log file for errors.\n\nEmpty output. Let me try starting it differently — perhaps the npm script needs to run from a regular shell.\n\nOn Windows, the `.bin/next` shell script doesn't work directly with `node`. Let me use the cmd approach.\n\nNothing is listening on 3005. The dev server didn't start. Let me try a simpler approach — start it as a background task properly.\n\nIt completed immediately with exit code 0 but no output, meaning the process isn't staying alive. Let me check what `npm run dev` does and try running it with `cmd.exe`.\n\nIt seems cmd.exe is not keeping the process running either. Let me try a different approach — use `start` command on Windows to launch in background properly.\n\nThe dev server is now running on port 3005 and responding with a 307 redirect (which is normal for Next.js). Let me verify the FO-09 page.\n\nFO-09 returns 200 on port 3005. Now let me run the E2E test with `TEST_URL` set to port 3005.\n\nThe test passed completely. Let me update the todos and close the tick.\n\nAll done. The **FO-09 E2E test passed** on the first run with all verifications confirmed:\n\n- **No progress bar** during discovery phase\n- **Welcome screens** (steps 0-2) completed successfully\n- **Sentence mode** on screen 1: 5 complete sentences (no \"...\" endings), \"More\" button expanded to 13\n- **Fragment mode** on screens 2-5: 8 fragments with \"...\" endings each, ellipsis correctly removed on click\n- **No reflective statements** on any discovery screen\n- **Heart animation** appeared between all screens\n- **5 affirmations** generated per batch (batch size verified via progress counter)\n- **Card-by-card review**: 3 loved, 2 discarded, progress \"X/5\" tracked correctly\n- **Summary screen** with both \"I am good with these\" and \"I want to create more\" buttons\n- **Post-review flow**: background → notifications → paywall → completion\n- **Completion screen** shows saved affirmations with markers\n\nTick `a8r` has been closed.",
