  "output": "I'll start by reviewing the reference component and existing FO-03 code to understand the patterns, then create the step-welcome component.\n\nNow I have both references. I see that:\n\n1. FO-02's step-welcome.tsx has a similar pattern with emojis, but according to the task spec, FO-03 should have different content without emojis (following the \"only use emojis if user explicitly requests\" guideline)\n2. FO-03's fo-experience.tsx already has placeholders for steps 0-2 that need to be replaced\n\nI'll create the step-welcome component for FO-03 following the same pattern but with the specific content from the task description.\n\nNow I need to update fo-experience.tsx to import and use the StepWelcome component instead of the placeholders.\n\nNow I need to update the renderStep function to use StepWelcome for steps 0-2.\n\nLet me verify the changes look correct by reading the updated file.\n\nThe changes look correct. Now let me run the dev server to test the implementation works.\n\nLint passes. Let me also run the build to make sure everything compiles correctly.\n\nLet me run a more explicit build command to see output.\n\nTypeScript compiles successfully. Now let me close the task and commit the changes.\n\nTask is closed. Now let me commit the changes.\n\nNow let me add the epic note.\n\nTask completed. I created the `step-welcome.tsx` component for FO-03 that handles Steps 0-2:\n\n- **Step 0**: Welcome screen with headline \"The way you speak to yourself becomes the way you live!\" and description \"Today is the day you get unique, personal affirmations.\" with Continue button\n- **Step 1**: Name input with \"What should we call you?\" headline, placeholder text, and disabled Continue button until name is entered\n- **Step 2**: Personalized welcome \"Welcome, {name}! Let us get to know you...\" with Start button\n\nUpdated `fo-experience.tsx` to import and use the StepWelcome component for steps 0-2, passing the appropriate props (currentStep, name, onNameChange, onContinue).",
