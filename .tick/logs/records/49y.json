  "output": "I'll start by reviewing the epic notes and understanding the current state of the codebase before implementing Step 13 (completion screen).\n\nLet me first read the relevant reference files to understand the patterns and existing implementations.\n\nNow I understand the current state. The FO-03 completion screen at Step 13 currently shows a placeholder (lines 580-589). I need to create `app/fo-03/components/step-completion.tsx` and integrate it.\n\nLet me also check the existing step components in FO-03 for consistent styling patterns:\n\nNow I have a clear picture of the styling patterns. Let me create the completion screen component. Based on the spec and epic context:\n\n- Headline: \"You are all set, {name} - this is your list!\"\n- Display all approved affirmations directly (not behind a button like FO-02)\n- Scrollable if many items\n- CTA: \"See my affirmations\" (shows list inline per spec - but since it's already showing, the CTA might not be needed, or it could be a confirmation)\n\nNow I need to integrate the component into `fo-experience.tsx`. I need to:\n1. Add the import for `StepCompletion`\n2. Replace the placeholder at case 13 with the actual component\n\nLet me verify the integration by reading the updated file to confirm everything looks correct:\n\nThe integration looks correct. Now let me run the build to make sure everything compiles correctly:\n\nBoth build and lint pass. Let me mark the verification as complete:\n\nNow let me close the task with tk:\n\nNow let me commit the changes:\n\nNow let me add an epic note for future iterations:\n\nTask completed. I've:\n\n1. Created `app/fo-03/components/step-completion.tsx` with:\n   - Headline \"You are all set, {name} — this is your list!\"\n   - Scrollable card list displaying all approved affirmations\n   - Each affirmation in a purple-tinted card with decorative icon\n   - Count summary showing number of affirmations saved\n   - Empty state handling with encouraging message when no affirmations saved\n\n2. Integrated the component into `fo-experience.tsx`:\n   - Added import for `StepCompletion`\n   - Replaced the placeholder at Step 13 with the actual component, passing `name` and `approvedAffirmations` props\n\n3. Verified build and lint pass successfully\n\n4. Committed with task ID `[49y]` in the commit message",
