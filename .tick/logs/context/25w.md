# Epic Context: 25w - FO-04: Foundation & Navigation

## Relevant Code
- `app/fo-03/` - Reference implementation to copy structure from
- `app/fo-03/layout.tsx` - Layout file pattern
- `app/fo-03/page.tsx` - Page file pattern
- `app/fo-03/fo-03-layout-client.tsx` - Client layout pattern
- `components/nav.config.ts` - Navigation configuration
- `app/overview/page.tsx` - Overview page to update

## Architecture
- Next.js App Router with nested layouts
- Each FO-XX has its own directory under app/
- Client-side layout wraps pages with navigation submenu
- nav.config.ts defines all navigation entries

## Testing
- Visual verification: navigate to /fo-04 in browser
- Build: `npm run build` should succeed

## Conventions
- FO-XX naming pattern for full onboarding variants
- layout.tsx for server layout, *-layout-client.tsx for client components
- page.tsx as route entry point
