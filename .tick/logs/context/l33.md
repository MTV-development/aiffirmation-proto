# Epic Context: l33 - FO-05: Fragment Input Component

## Relevant Code
- `app/fo-04/components/dynamic-input.tsx` - Reference component (~216 lines)
- `docs/projects/2026-01-25-fo-05/2026-01-25-fo-05-spec.md` - Spec with detailed UI flow

## Architecture
- React functional component with useState for local state
- Framer Motion for animations (AnimatePresence, motion)
- Props interface defines data and callbacks

## Key UI Flow (from spec)
1. Initial State: Input field with "Start typing..." placeholder, "Inspiration" link below
2. After clicking Inspiration: 5 fragment chips appear, "More Inspiration" link below
3. After clicking a fragment: Fragment appended to input (with space), "Continue typing" button appears, chips become inactive
4. After clicking "Continue typing": Cursor at end, button disappears, chips active, Continue button enabled
5. After clicking "More Inspiration": 8 more fragments appear, link disappears

## State to Track
- showInspiration: boolean - whether inspiration section is visible
- showMoreInspiration: boolean - whether expanded fragments are shown
- pendingFragment: string | null - fragment clicked but not yet 'continued'
- hasUserTyped: boolean - whether user has typed (enables Continue button)

## Testing
- Build command: `npm run build`

## Conventions
- Multi-line chips with wrapped text (whitespace-normal)
- Value is just { text: string } (no selectedChips)
- Use initialFragments (5) and expandedFragments (8)
