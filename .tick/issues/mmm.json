Dynamic detail-gathering flow:\n   - Verify reflective statement and question appear (after first screen)\n   - Test chip selection (clicking adds chip to input field)\n   - Test chip removal (clicking - removes chip)\n   - Test free-text input\n   - Verify 'Next' is disabled until input provided\n   - Test 'Show more' chip expansion\n3. Verify flow progresses through 2-5 dynamic screens\n4. Transition to affirmation generation\n5. Swipe phase (same as FO-03)\n6. Completion screen\n\nUse Playwright patterns from fo-03.test.ts.\nRun in headless: false for development, headless: true for CI.",
