  "description": "Implement FO-02 - same 10-step onboarding as FO-01 but with real iterative improvement. Generates affirmations in batches of 10, using approved/skipped selections to improve each batch.",
  "notes": "2026-01-17 08:38 - Completed s7m (Agent \u0026 Backend): Created src/mastra/agents/fo-02/ with createFO02Agent factory and app/fo-02/actions.ts with generateAffirmationBatchFO02. The action uses prompt_initial for batch 1 and prompt_with_feedback for batches 2-3, passing approvedAffirmations, skippedAffirmations, and allPreviousAffirmations to the template. KV seed data was already added in xi4. Next: UI components need to call generateAffirmationBatchFO02 with batchNumber (1, 2, or 3) and accumulated feedback.",
