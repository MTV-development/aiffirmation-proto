  "title": "FO-02: Full Onboarding with Iterative Improvement",
  "description": "Implement FO-02 - same 10-step onboarding as FO-01 but with real iterative improvement. Generates affirmations in batches of 10, using approved/skipped selections to improve each batch.",
  "notes": "2026-01-17 08:38 - Completed s7m (Agent \u0026 Backend): Created src/mastra/agents/fo-02/ with createFO02Agent factory and app/fo-02/actions.ts with generateAffirmationBatchFO02. The action uses prompt_initial for batch 1 and prompt_with_feedback for batches 2-3, passing approvedAffirmations, skippedAffirmations, and allPreviousAffirmations to the template. KV seed data was already added in xi4. Next: UI components need to call generateAffirmationBatchFO02 with batchNumber (1, 2, or 3) and accumulated feedback.\n2026-01-17 08:39 - s7m complete: FO-02 agent and backend implemented. Agent definition, server actions, and Mastra registration done. KV store seed data was already added by xi4. The generateAffirmationBatchFO02 action uses prompt_initial for batch 1 and prompt_with_feedback for batches 2-3, passing approvedAffirmations, skippedAffirmations, and allPreviousAffirmations to the template.\n2026-01-17 08:47 - yd7 complete: FO-02 UI components implemented. Created app/fo-02/components/ with all step components plus GenerationLoading for batch loading states. The fo-experience.tsx manages batch generation flow - calls generateAffirmationBatchFO02 with batchNumber (1/2/3) and accumulated feedback. Added FO-02 to nav.config.ts and overview page. Info page created at app/fo-02/info/page.tsx. Build and lint pass.\n2026-01-17 08:51 - 4y2 complete: Verified FO-02 Navigation \u0026 Pages. All work was already done by yd7 iteration - nav config, info page, and overview page all in place. Just closed the child tasks (vk5, ejs, ek6, rlt) and the epic. Build and lint verified.\n2026-01-17 08:56 - c8r complete: Created e2e/fo-02.test.ts with full E2E test coverage. Test covers the complete 3-batch iterative flow including loading states between batches, feedback loop verification, checkpoint navigation, and completion screen. Test passes successfully - all SC criteria met including SC-006 (E2E test passes).",
