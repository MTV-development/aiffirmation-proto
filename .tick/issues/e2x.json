  "notes": "2026-02-11 15:27 - EPIC COMPLETE: Created comprehensive E2E tests for FO-11 in e2e/fo-11.test.ts. Tests cover both non-skip (brief goal) and skip (rich goal) flows, validating LLM-generated questions, fragment chips, single-word tone chips, heart animations, card review, create-more second batch, and full completion. Both flows pass end-to-end. Test runs in ~3-4 minutes total (two full browser sessions). Key pattern: test uses shared helper functions extracted into named functions (runWelcomeSteps, runFamiliarityStep, etc.) making it easy to compose flow variations.",
