  "notes": "2026-01-27 12:17 - Key insight: FO-07 discovery agent returns initialFragments/expandedFragments (like FO-06) but the actions.ts maps these to initialChips/expandedChips for UI compatibility. The isValidDynamicScreenResponse function handles both formats.\n2026-01-27 12:17 - EPIC COMPLETE: Created server actions with generateDynamicScreen, generateAffirmations20 (all 20 at once), and generateReviewSummary.
