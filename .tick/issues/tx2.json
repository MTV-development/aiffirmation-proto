  "notes": "2026-01-28 07:53 - Key insight: FO-08 discovery agent uses same factory pattern as FO-07 (createFO08DiscoveryAgent function + DEFAULT_INSTRUCTIONS fallback). The hybrid fragment prompt is ~150 lines and includes: 5 Dimensions framework, hybrid fragment principle with comparison table, examples by dimension (8 per dimension), key rules, and output format with example JSON showing 8 initialFragments + 15 expandedFragments.\n2026-01-28 07:57 - Affirmation agent uses ID 'fo-08-affirmation' (not 'fo-08-affirmation-agent'). Summary agent follows same pre/post pattern as FO-07 with legacy exports for backwards compatibility.\n2026-01-28 08:04 - Key insight: FO-08 prompts differ from FO-07 in using selectedFragments instead of selectedChips in prompt templates, generating 20 affirmations instead of 10, and using pre-affirmation summary style (future tense) by default\n2026-01-28 08:06 - KV store seeded with FO-08 prompts\n2026-01-28 08:06 - EPIC COMPLETE: Created discovery agent with hybrid fragment prompt, copied affirmation/summary agents, added KV prompts, ran db:seed.",
