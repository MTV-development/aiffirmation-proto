  "notes": "2026-01-23 09:11 - Task l0b completed - created e2e/fo-03.test.ts. Test follows fo-02 pattern with helper functions (clickButton, waitForText, waitForTextContaining, swipeThroughBatch). Key differences: handles confetti auto-advance (2s sleeps after steps 3-4), heart animation waits (2.5s after steps 5-6), and uses chip selection instead of textarea input for most steps. Test selects 'I am good with the affirmations I chose' at checkpoint 1 to speed up test execution (only 1 batch). Run with: node --import tsx e2e/fo-03.test.ts\n2026-01-23 09:56 - (from: Morten Elk) Closed",
