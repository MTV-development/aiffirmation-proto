  "description": "Create FO-05 discovery agent with sentence fragment generation\n\n## Context\n\n**Spec:** `docs/projects/2026-01-25-fo-05/2026-01-25-fo-05-spec.md`\n\n**Key files for this epic:**\n- `src/mastra/agents/fo-04/agent.ts` - Reference agent to adapt\n- `src/mastra/agents/fo-04/affirmation-agent.ts` - Affirmation agent to copy\n- `app/fo-04/actions.ts` - Server actions pattern to follow\n\n**Key differences from FO-04:**\n- Agent receives both question AND answer (not just answer) for better context\n- Agent generates varied reflective statements (avoid 'It sounds like...')\n- Agent generates 13 sentence fragments (5 initial + 8 expanded) instead of chips",
  "notes": "2026-01-24 08:09 - Key insight: Fragment system prompt differences from FO-04 - (1) Output uses initialFragments/expandedFragments not chips, (2) Exactly 5 initial + 8 expanded = 13 total, (3) Fragments are sentence starters ending with '...' like 'I'm feeling overwhelmed because...', (4) Added explicit instruction to vary reflective statements with alternative openings beyond 'It sounds like...'\n2026-01-24 08:13 - FO-05 actions.ts follows FO-04 pattern closely. Key changes: 1) DynamicScreenResponse uses initialFragments/expandedFragments instead of chips, 2) GatheringContext.exchanges use selectedFragments instead of selectedChips, 3) Import from fo-05 agents. Both buildDiscoveryPrompt already included question+answer in FO-04, so that pattern was preserved.",
