  "notes": "2026-02-09 10:05 - FO-10 chip agent uses gpt-4o (not gpt-4o-mini). Output format is {initialChips, expandedChips} not {initialFragments, expandedFragments} like FO-09. Step-specific behavior via 3 user prompt templates: prompt_step_5 (fragments with ...), prompt_step_6 (complete sentences about situations), prompt_step_7 (complete sentences about tone). Agent ID convention is 'fo-10-chip' not 'fo-10-discovery'.\n2026-02-09 10:08 - FO-10 affirmation agent created following same pattern as chip agent: new agent file with agentId 'fo-10-affirmation', gpt-4o model via KV seed, and exports in index.ts. Both agents now have matching KV seed structure (_info.default and _model_name.default entries).",
