Import from local FO-05 components\n2. Import actions from ../actions (FO-05 actions)\n3. Update DynamicScreenData interface to use initialFragments/expandedFragments\n4. Update dynamic step value handling - no selectedChips, just text\n5. When passing value to StepDynamic, only pass { text: string }\n\nThe overall flow (12 steps) remains the same as FO-04.",
