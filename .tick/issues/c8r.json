  "closed_reason": "Created e2e/fo-02.test.ts with full 3-batch iterative flow testing. Test verifies: (1) batch-by-batch generation with loading states, (2) feedback loop where approved/skipped affirmations inform subsequent batches, (3) all checkpoints navigate correctly, (4) final checkpoint only shows Continue button, (5) completion screen displays saved affirmations. Test passes successfully."
