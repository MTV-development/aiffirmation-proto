  "notes": "2026-02-16 14:55 - EPIC COMPLETE: FO-12 E2E test written and passing. Key file: e2e/fo-12.test.ts. Test runs in ~3-4 minutes covering all 16 steps. Important pattern: card flow transitions need waitForNextCard helper (600ms settle + text change detection) due to AnimatePresence spring animations. Phase 3 continuous review uses dynamic card detection with emergency batch generation handling.",
