  "description": "Create three NEW components for the card-based affirmation review.\n\n## 1. app/fo-09/components/affirmation-card.tsx\n\nSingle affirmation card with:\n- Large card with affirmation text (centered, prominent)\n- Two buttons below: \"Love it\" (primary/purple styling) and \"Discard\" (secondary/neutral styling)\n- Slide-left exit animation using Framer Motion (current card slides out left, next slides in from right)\n- Props: affirmation: string, onLove: () =\u003e void, onDiscard: () =\u003e void\n\n## 2. app/fo-09/components/affirmation-card-flow.tsx\n\nOrchestrates the card-by-card review of a batch of 5 affirmations:\n- Progress bar at top with \"3/5\" style counter that fills as user advances\n- Renders one AffirmationCard at a time\n- Tracks loved and discarded arrays internally\n- Calls onComplete(loved: string[], discarded: string[]) when all 5 reviewed\n- Uses AnimatePresence for slide-left transitions between cards\n\nProps: affirmations: string[], onComplete: (loved: string[], discarded: string[]) =\u003e void\n\n## 3. app/fo-09/components/affirmation-summary.tsx\n\nShows loved affirmations after reviewing a batch:\n- Heading: \"Your affirmations\" or similar\n- Flat list of all loved affirmations (no batch distinction)\n- Count: \"X affirmations collected\"\n- If affirmations exist: two buttons:\n  - \"I am good with these\" (primary, purple) -\u003e calls onDone()\n  - \"I want to create more\" (secondary) -\u003e calls onMore()\n- If no affirmations: message \"None of those resonated? Let us try again.\" + single \"Generate new affirmations\" button -\u003e calls onMore()\n\nProps: lovedAffirmations: string[], onDone: () =\u003e void, onMore: () =\u003e void\n\nAll components use Framer Motion for animations and follow FO-08 dark theme styling (gray-900 bg, gray-200 text, purple accents).\n\nFiles to create:\n- app/fo-09/components/affirmation-card.tsx\n- app/fo-09/components/affirmation-card-flow.tsx\n- app/fo-09/components/affirmation-summary.tsx\n\nDo not close until acceptance criteria pass.",
