  "description": "Create the summary agent that generates a personalized 2-3 sentence summary of the user's journey.\n\n## Files to create:\n- `src/mastra/agents/fo-05/summary-agent.ts`\n\n## Implementation:\n1. Create agent similar to affirmation-agent.ts structure\n2. Use agent ID: 'fo-05-summary'\n3. System prompt should instruct the agent to:\n   - Write in second person ('You've been...')\n   - Keep it 2-3 sentences (~50-80 words)\n   - Structure: Situation → Wish for change → Purpose of affirmations\n   - Use warm, supportive tone\n   - Synthesize themes, don't repeat exact phrases\n\n## Output format:\nPlain text (no JSON) - a paragraph summary.\n\n## Example output:\n'You've been carrying a lot of pressure at work while trying to stay present for the people you love. You're looking for more calm and self-compassion in the moments that feel overwhelming. These affirmations are crafted to remind you that you're already doing enough — and that rest is not something you need to earn.'\n\n## Reference files:\n- `src/mastra/agents/fo-05/affirmation-agent.ts` for agent structure\n- `app/fo-05/actions.ts` for GatheringContext interface",
