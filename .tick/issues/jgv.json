Verify each batch generation completes successfully\n4. Verify no duplicate affirmations across batches\n5. Verify completion screen shows approved affirmations\n\nKey differences from FO-01 test:\n- Must wait for 3 separate generation calls (not just 1)\n- Loading states appear between batches\n- Each batch takes up to 60s for AI generation\n\nSee SPEC.md section 'E2E Tests' and docs/current/e2e-testing.md.",
