  "notes": "2026-01-23 08:06 - Task [ilu] complete: Created FO-03 directory structure following FO-02 patterns. page.tsx has placeholder content since FOExperience component doesn't exist yet - will be created in future epic. Navigation won't work until task [ehg] adds FO-03 entry to nav.config.ts.\n2026-01-23 08:08 - Task [ehg] complete: Added FO-03 entry to nav.config.ts at lines 99-106, after FO-02 and before Settings. Entry follows standard pattern with Demo and Info children. Note: /fo-03/info will 404 until an info page is created - this is expected for now.",
