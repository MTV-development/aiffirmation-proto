    "output": "I'll start by reviewing the task details and understanding what needs to be done.\n\nBased on the epic notes, it appears that yd7 (completed by a previous iteration) already implemented the navigation config, info page, and overview page. Let me verify what has been done:\n\nLet me check the overview page to see if FO-02 is included there:\n\nLooking at all the files, I can see that the previous iteration (yd7) has already completed all the work for this task:\n\n1. **Navigation config** - `nav.config.ts` already has FO-02 entry at lines 92-98\n2. **Info page** - `app/fo-02/info/page.tsx` is fully implemented with a comprehensive info page\n3. **Overview page** - `app/overview/page.tsx` already includes FO-02 in both the versions array (lines 104-112) and the comparison table (lines 244-250)\n\nLet me verify that everything builds and lints correctly:\n\nBoth lint and build pass. Let me verify the FO-02 main page exists and works:\n\nAll the required work for this task is already complete from the previous iteration (yd7). The navigation config, info page, and overview page updates are all in place and working.\n\nLet me close the task and commit:\n\nAh, this is an epic with children tasks. Let me check the children and close them:\n\nThe work was done in the yd7 task but the child tasks weren't closed. Let me close each of them:\n\nNow let me close the parent epic:\n\nNow let me commit the changes (only the ticket files have been modified):\n\nNow let me add an epic note for the parent f2m epic:\n\nThe task has been completed. There's still one remaining task (c8r - FO-02 E2E Testing) in the epic, but that's for the next iteration.\n\n**Summary:** Task 4y2 (FO-02 Navigation \u0026 Pages) was already implemented by the yd7 iteration. I verified:\n- `nav.config.ts` has FO-02 entry at lines 92-98\n- `app/fo-02/info/page.tsx` has a comprehensive info page\n- `app/overview/page.tsx` includes FO-02 in both the versions array and comparison table\n- Build and lint pass\n\nI closed the four child tasks (vk5, ejs, ek6, rlt) and the parent epic 4y2, then committed the changes and added an epic note.",
