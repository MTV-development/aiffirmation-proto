After max 3 batches or user chooses to stop, show transition and proceed to Step 10\n\nState updates:\n- Track currentBatchNumber (1-3)\n- Accumulate approvedAffirmations and skippedAffirmations across batches\n- Pass all onboarding data to generateAffirmationBatchFO03\n\nReference app/fo-02/components/fo-experience.tsx for batch generation flow.",

  "closed_reason": "Integrated swipe phase and checkpoints into fo-experience.tsx. Added imports for SwipePhase, StepCheckpoint, and server action. Added hasSwipedOnce state tracking. Implemented generateBatch function calling generateAffirmationBatchFO03 with all onboarding context. Added swipe helper functions. Steps 8-9 now show: loading during generation, SwipePhase for swiping cards with persistent messaging, StepCheckpoint variants (batch1/subsequent/transition) after each batch. Users can swipe up to 3 batches or choose to stop early."
