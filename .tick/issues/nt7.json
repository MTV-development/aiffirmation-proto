  "notes": "2026-01-23 08:36 - v3c complete: Created FO-03 agent following FO-02 pattern. DEFAULT_INSTRUCTIONS include a new 'Understanding the User' section that explains how to use the richer context (name, familiarity, topics, situation, feelings, whatHelps). The createFO03Agent factory supports KV store configuration override.\n2026-01-23 08:38 - 6ji complete: Added 5 FO-03 KV store entries (_info, _model_name, _temperature, prompt_initial, prompt_with_feedback). Templates flatten the FO-03 data structure into separate variables (e.g., situation_text and situation_chips instead of situation.text and situation.chips) to work with Liquid templating. The prompt_with_feedback includes approvedAffirmations, skippedAffirmations, and allPreviousAffirmations arrays for iterative learning.\n2026-01-23 08:41 - 9rc complete: Created app/fo-03/actions.ts with generateAffirmationBatchFO03 server action. Key design: flattens nested objects (situation, feelings, whatHelps) into flat variables (situation_text, situation_chips, etc.) to match the KV store template format established in 6ji. The parseAffirmationsResponse helper is duplicated from FO-02 to keep actions self-contained - consider extracting to shared utility if pattern repeats.",
