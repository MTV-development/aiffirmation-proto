If test fails, analyze the error\n2. Fix the component or test as needed\n3. Re-run until passing\n\nCommon issues:\n- Selector not found: Update selector to match actual DOM\n- Timeout on generation: Increase timeout or check server action\n- Animation timing: Add waits or adjust expectations\n- Step not advancing: Check state management\n\nThe test should complete the full 13-step flow successfully.",
