  "notes": "2026-02-09 10:20 - fo-experience.tsx: Key implementation notes: (1) discoveryStep (0-3) tracks position in FO10_QUESTIONS array, (2) discoveryInputs array stores 4 separate input states, (3) heart animations show between each discovery step using showHeartAnimation flag, (4) needsChipFetch flag triggers chip loading for steps 5-7, (5) chip generation and affirmation generation are stubbed (TODO: implement server actions), (6) FamiliarityLevel type was 'some' in FO-09 but 'somewhat' in FO-10 types - updated StepFamiliarity accordingly. Next worker: implement server actions for chip generation and affirmation generation.\n2026-02-09 10:28 - Server actions wired up in fo-experience.tsx. generateChips uses step number 5/6/7 directly. generateAffirmationBatchFO10 reuses FO-09 affirmation agent. Both actions parse JSON responses with fallback error handling. No implementation selector needed for FO-10 (single implementation only per spec).",
