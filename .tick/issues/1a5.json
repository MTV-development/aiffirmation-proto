    "output": "I'll start by reviewing the existing CS-01 SwipePhase component to understand the pattern, then create the vertical swipe version for FO-01.\n\nNow I understand both files. I need to create a vertical swipe component for FO-01 that:\n1. Uses y motion value instead of x\n2. Down = keep (saved), Up = discard\n3. Shows counter \"Affirmation X of 10\"\n4. Shows \"Swipe for next\" label\n5. Shows \"Successfully saved\" / \"Discarded\" feedback\n\nLet me also check the types file from CS-01 to understand the interface pattern.\n\nNow I have all the context I need. Let me create the vertical swipe phase component for FO-01.\n\nNow I need to integrate this component into the fo-experience.tsx. Let me update the step 5 rendering to use the new SwipePhase component.\n\nNow let me update step 5 to use the SwipePhase component instead of the placeholder implementation.\n\nNow let me run lint to verify the code quality.\n\nLint passes. Let me also run the build to make sure everything compiles correctly.\n\nLet me check if the build actually completed by looking at the output differently.\n\nThe build succeeded without errors. Now let me update the todos and close the task.\n\nNow let me add a note to the epic for the next iteration.\n\nTask [1a5] completed successfully. I created:\n\n1. **`app/fo-01/components/swipe-phase.tsx`** - A vertical swipe card component adapted from CS-01's horizontal SwipePhase with:\n   - Vertical swipe using `y` motion value instead of `x`\n   - Down = keep (toward user), Up = discard (away from user)\n   - Counter showing \"Affirmation X of 10\"\n   - Direction labels (\"Keep\" at bottom, \"Discard\" at top)\n   - Toast feedback (\"Successfully saved\" / \"Discarded\")\n   - Keyboard support: ArrowDown = keep, ArrowUp = discard\n   - ~100px swipe threshold with velocity detection\n\n2. **Updated `app/fo-01/components/fo-experience.tsx`**:\n   - Imported SwipePhase and SwipeDirection type\n   - Replaced step 5's placeholder with the new SwipePhase component\n   - Connected swipe directions to approve/skip affirmation handlers\n   - Batch complete screen handles steps 6.1/6.3 with \"See More\" and \"Continue\" options",
