  "description": "## Objective\n\nCreate the main FO-10 flow controller that orchestrates the fixed 4-question discovery sequence, replacing FO-09's dynamic question generation with hardcoded questions.\n\n## Spec Reference\n\n**Spec:** `docs/projects/2026-02-09-fo-10/2026-02-09-fo-10-spec.md` — Section: \"Flow\" and \"GatheringContext Adaptation\"\n\n## Scope\n\n**Files to create:**\n- `app/fo-10/components/fo-experience.tsx` — main flow controller\n\n**Key existing code:**\n- `app/fo-09/components/fo-experience.tsx` — reference implementation\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Adapt FO-09's fo-experience.tsx state structure\n2. Replace dynamic screen logic with fixed 4-step discovery (steps 4-7)\n3. Each discovery step uses hardcoded question from FO10_QUESTIONS constant\n4. Build exchanges array as `{ question: FO10_QUESTIONS[index], answer: { text: \"...\" } }`\n5. Heart animations between each discovery step (4 total)\n6. Steps 8-14 identical to FO-09 (generation, card review, summary, post-review)\n7. Step 4 shows predefined chips, steps 5-7 load LLM chips via server actions\n\n## Tests\n\n1. TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes\n2. Verify component exports\n\nDo NOT close until acceptance criteria pass.",
