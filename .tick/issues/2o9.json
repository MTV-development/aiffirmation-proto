  "notes": "2026-01-27 12:22 - AffirmationReview component created at app/fo-07/components/affirmation-review.tsx. Uses Lucide icons (ThumbsUp, ThumbsDown), framer-motion for animations, and follows FO-04/FO-06 styling patterns. Rating state is managed as an array matching affirmation indices.\n2026-01-27 12:23 - Base UI components copied from FO-04 to FO-07 with minimal changes. Only step-topics.tsx required copy updates (H1/H2 text). step-dynamic.tsx imports GatheringContext and DynamicScreenResponse types from ../actions - ensure these are exported from FO-07's actions.ts\n2026-01-27 12:27 - FO-07 FOExperience created at app/fo-07/components/fo-experience.tsx. Flow: Steps 0-2 welcome, Step 3 topics (passes currentStep=4 to StepTopics), Step 4 dynamic screens with heart transitions, Step 5 generation loading, Step 6 AffirmationReview, Steps 7-9 mockups, Step 10 completion. Total 11 steps (0-10). Uses generateAffirmations20 and generateReviewSummary from ../actions.\n2026-01-27 12:28 - EPIC COMPLETE: All UI components created. Key files: fo-experience.tsx (main state manager), affirmation-review.tsx (new 20-card review), plus 9 base components copied from FO-04.",
