  "notes": "2026-01-26 11:04 - FO-06 directory structure follows FO-05 pattern exactly. Layout client gracefully handles missing nav.config entry (returns empty array). Navigation entry for FO-06 in nav.config.ts should be added in a separate task.\n2026-01-26 11:06 - l6q: Added FO-06 to navigation and overview. Pattern: nav.config.ts needs label/href/children array with Demo+Info, overview page needs both a version card AND a table row. FO-05 table row was missing border-b class - fixed that while adding FO-06.",
