  "description": "Create FO-10 app directory structure and adapt UI components from FO-09 for the fixed 4-question flow.\n\n## Spec\n`docs/projects/2026-02-09-fo-10/2026-02-09-fo-10-spec.md`\n\n## Key Files\n- `app/fo-10/types.ts` — adapted from FO-09 with FO10_QUESTIONS constant\n- `app/fo-10/components/` — copy/adapt FragmentInput, HeartAnimation, step components from FO-09\n- `app/fo-10/components/step-goal.tsx` — new component for step 4 (predefined topic chips)\n\n## Worker Notes\n- Workers have CLAUDE.md context and persistent memory\n- Many components can be copied directly from FO-09\n- Key difference: fixed questions instead of AI-generated questions",
  "notes": "2026-02-09 10:12 - Task kyj completed successfully. Created FO-10 directory with types.ts and components/. Key learnings: (1) All FO-09 components copied work as-is without import path changes, (2) FO10_QUESTIONS array properly typed as const for type safety, (3) FO10OnboardingData includes familiarityLevel field not present in FO-09's GatheringContext - this aligns with spec's familiarity step, (4) Components ready for immediate use in fo-experience.tsx implementation.\n2026-02-09 10:15 - All 4 discovery step components created and type-safe. Step-goal uses predefined TOPIC_OPTIONS array (36 chips from FO-09). Steps 5-7 use FragmentInput with mode prop (fragments vs sentences). All components follow same pattern: check currentStep prop, get question from FO10_QUESTIONS array, pass props to input component.",
