  "description": "## Scope\n\nDelivers all UI components for FO-12: copied base components from FO-11 (with import path adjustments), modified components (welcome, familiarity, completion), and new components (start screen, check-in screens, phase-aware card flow).\n\n## Spec Reference\n\n`docs/projects/2026-02-16-fo-12/2026-02-16-fo-12-spec.md` — Sections: \"Reuse from FO-11\", \"New/Modified Components\", \"Selection Phase 1-3\", \"Start Screen\", \"Check-in 1\", \"Check-in 2\"\n\n## Key Files\n\n- `app/fo-12/components/` — All 15 component files\n- Copied from FO-11: fragment-input, heart-animation, affirmation-card, step-background, step-notifications, step-paywall, step-goal, step-context, step-tone\n- Modified from FO-11: step-welcome (2 sub-steps, new copy), step-familiarity (new text+options), step-completion (30 items)\n- New: step-start (motivational screen), step-checkin (parameterized for check-in 1 and 2), affirmation-card-flow (global counter, phase-aware, continuous mode)\n\n## Worker Instructions\n\n- Complete tasks in order (they build on each other)\n- Read `docs/projects/2026-02-16-fo-12/implementation-notes.md` before starting\n- Append your learnings to `docs/projects/2026-02-16-fo-12/implementation-notes.md` when all tasks are done\n- Components should NOT import from `app/fo-12/types.ts` — use prop interfaces instead. The state machine wires everything.\n- Copy FO-11 components and adjust ONLY: import paths (fo-11 → fo-12), text changes per spec\n- New components: step-start is static; step-checkin is parameterized (phase 1 or 2); affirmation-card-flow needs totalLovedSoFar and target props for global counter",
  "notes": "2026-02-16 14:34 - EPIC COMPLETE: All 15 UI components created in app/fo-12/components/. 9 base copies from FO-11 (with step number guard updates), 3 modified (welcome 2-substep, familiarity new text, completion dynamic count), 3 new (step-start static, step-checkin parameterized phase 1/2, affirmation-card-flow with global counter + onRequestMore). No types.ts imports in components -- all prop-based. Step numbering: welcome 0-1, familiarity 2, goal 3, context 4, tone 5.",
