    "output": "I'll start by reviewing the existing step components and the main experience component to understand the patterns, then create the swipe intro step component.\n\nI've reviewed the existing components. Now I understand the pattern. I need to:\n\n1. Create a new step component `step-swipe-intro.tsx` for Step 4 - the swipe explanation screen\n2. Update `fo-experience.tsx` to use this new component and handle the loading state appropriately\n\nLooking at the current code, Step 4 currently shows a loading/error state. The task asks for a \"Before Swipe\" step that should show a loading state if affirmations are still generating, then allow the user to click Start once ready.\n\nLet me create the swipe intro component.\n\nNow I need to update `fo-experience.tsx` to use this new component for step 4 instead of the inline loading/error state. The component should show the swipe intro with a loading indicator until affirmations are ready, then let the user click Start to proceed.\n\nNow I need to update case 4 to use the StepSwipeIntro component instead of the current inline implementation.\n\nNow let me run the build and lint to make sure there are no errors.\n\nThe build passed without errors. Let me verify the build actually completed by checking the output directory or trying a different command.\n\nBuild completed successfully. Now let me close the task and commit the changes.\n\nNow let me add an epic note for future iterations.\n\nTask completed. I created the `StepSwipeIntro` component for Step 4 of the FO-01 onboarding flow. The component:\n\n- Shows a personalized headline with the user's name and emoji\n- Explains swipe mechanics (DOWN to keep, UP to skip)\n- Displays a loading spinner if affirmations are still being generated\n- Shows the Start button once affirmations are ready\n\nThe main experience component was updated to use `StepSwipeIntro` for step 4, with the error handling retained inline for the \"Try Again\" flow.",
