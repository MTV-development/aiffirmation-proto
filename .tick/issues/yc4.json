  "notes": "2026-01-23 09:00 - Steps 10-12 mockups complete. Step 13 (completion) still uses placeholder - next task should implement step-completion.tsx to display approvedAffirmations list with the user's name.\n2026-01-23 09:02 - Step 13 (completion) implemented with StepCompletion component. Shows affirmations list directly (no button click needed), has empty state, and follows FO-03 styling patterns. All post-swipe mockups (Steps 10-13) are now complete.\n2026-01-23 09:04 - Task qkb (wire up post-swipe screens): Verified integration is complete - all 4 post-swipe components (StepBackground, StepNotifications, StepPaywall, StepCompletion) are properly imported and rendered in fo-experience.tsx. Flow works correctly: goToStep(10) after swipe checkpoints, nextStep() advances through each screen. No code changes needed as previous iterations completed this work.",
