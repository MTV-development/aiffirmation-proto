Read the error message\n2. Check the screenshot if one was saved\n3. Fix the issue in the relevant component/action\n4. Re-run the test\n5. Repeat until ALL assertions pass\n\n**Key things to verify:**\n- No progress bar at any point\n- Fixed opening question text matches exactly\n- Fragment interaction works\n- Full flow completes\n\n⚠️ Do not close until the E2E test passes completely.\n   If tests fail, fix the issues and re-run until green.",
