    "output": "I'll start by reviewing the existing FO-01 experience component to understand the current structure and how these steps will integrate.\n\nNow I understand the structure. The current FOExperience component has inline step rendering. According to the task, I need to create a separate component file `step-welcome.tsx` that handles Steps 0, 1, and 2 with the exact copy from spec including emojis.\n\nLet me check if there are other step component files as examples to follow the pattern.\n\nOnly the main experience component exists. I'll create the `step-welcome.tsx` component. Let me also check the task spec once more for the exact props and copy.\n\nNow I'll create the step-welcome.tsx component with the exact copy from the spec.\n\nNow I need to update the main FOExperience component to use this new StepWelcome component instead of the inline rendering for steps 0-2.\n\nNow I need to replace the inline steps 0, 1, and 2 with the StepWelcome component.\n\nNow let me run the lint check to make sure there are no issues.\n\nLint passes. Let me also run the build to make sure everything compiles correctly.\n\nThe build is running. Let me wait for the output.\n\nBuild passed. Now let me update the todo and close the task.\n\nNow let me close the task with tk close.\n\nNow let me add an epic note for future iterations.\n\nTask completed. I created `app/fo-01/components/step-welcome.tsx` with:\n\n- **Step 0**: Welcome headline \"The way you speak to yourself becomes the way you live. 🌿🌸\" with Continue button\n- **Step 1**: Name input with \"What should we call you? 🌸\" headline, placeholder \"Type your first name\", and Continue button disabled until name is entered\n- **Step 2**: Personalized welcome \"Welcome, {name} 💛 Let's create affirmations that feel right for you.\" with Continue button\n\nUpdated `fo-experience.tsx` to import and use the new `StepWelcome` component for steps 0-2 via case fall-through in the switch statement. Build and lint pass.",
