  "notes": "2026-01-27 12:41 - Key insight: FO-07 uses AffirmationReview component (not swipe gestures) requiring click-based rating of all 20 cards. The heart animation uses an SVG with viewBox='0 0 24 24' and auto-advances after 2.5s. Chip suggestions have '+ ' prefix. The Continue button text changes between 'Rate all X remaining to continue' (disabled) and 'Continue with N Affirmations' (enabled) to indicate state.\n2026-01-27 12:42 - EPIC COMPLETE: E2E test created covering full FO-07 flow - welcome screens, topic selection with new copy, chip-based dynamic screens, heart animations, 20-affirmation review with thumbs up/down, and completion.
