  "closed_reason": "Wired up Steps 5-7 in fo-experience.tsx using TextWithChips and HeartAnimation components. Added showHeartAnimation state to manage transition animations between steps. Step 5 (situation) and Step 6 (feelings) show heart animation on Continue before advancing. Step 7 (whatHelps) advances directly. Added chip data constants for all three steps per spec. 'Not sure' skips the step without heart animation."
