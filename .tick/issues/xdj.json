    "output": "I'll start by reading the reference files to understand the E2E testing patterns used in this project.\n\nNow let me review the FO-01 experience component to understand the UI flow I need to test.\n\nNow let me look at the individual step components to understand the specific UI elements I need to interact with in the test.\n\nNow I have a comprehensive understanding of the FO-01 flow. Let me create the E2E test file.\n\nNow let me run lint to verify the test file compiles correctly.\n\nLint passed. Now let me close the task and commit the changes.\n\nNow let me add a note for the epic about this task.\n\nI've completed the task. Here's a summary:\n\n**Created FO-01 E2E test at `e2e/fo-01.test.ts`**\n\nThe test follows the same Playwright pattern as `full-process-3.test.ts` and covers the complete onboarding flow:\n\n1. **Steps 0-2 (Welcome)**: Navigate to /fo-01, click Continue, enter name \"TestUser\", click through personalized welcome\n2. **Step 3 (Intent)**: Enter intention \"I want to feel more confident\", click Continue\n3. **Step 4 (Loading)**: Wait for AI generation (60s timeout), click Start when ready\n4. **Step 5 (Swiping)**: Use keyboard ArrowDown to keep 2 affirmations, ArrowUp to skip remaining 8\n5. **Step 6 (Checkpoint)**: Click \"I'm good with the affirmations I chose\"\n6. **Steps 7-9 (Illustrative)**: Click through background selection, notifications, and paywall (using \"Not now\")\n7. **Step 10 (Completion)**: Verify \"You're all set\" message appears, click \"See my affirmations\" and verify the list displays\n\nKey implementation details:\n- Uses `e2e_test_mode` cookie for password bypass\n- Keyboard navigation for swipe cards (ArrowDown = keep, ArrowUp = discard)\n- Helper functions: `clickButton`, `waitForText`, `waitForTextContaining`\n- Debug screenshots on failure at each step",
