  "description": "Update fo-experience.tsx to generate and pass the summary to completion screen.\n\nFiles to modify:\n- app/fo-05/components/fo-experience.tsx\n\nChanges:\n\n1. Add completionSummary to OnboardingState (initially empty string)\n\n2. Add isGeneratingSummary state for loading indication (optional)\n\n3. Generate summary when transitioning to completion step:\n   - When user finishes post-swipe screens and moves to step 12 (completion)\n   - Call generateCompletionSummary with gatheringContext\n   - Store result in state\n\n4. Pass summary prop to StepCompletion component\n\n5. Handle the async nature:\n   - Generate summary when entering completion step\n   - Can show completion screen immediately with loading state for summary\n   - Or generate before showing (simpler approach)\n\nReference the GatheringContext that accumulates during the flow - it has all the exchanges needed.",
