  "notes": "2026-01-28 08:04 - Key insight: FO-08 fo-experience.tsx uses separate API calls for screen 1 (generateFirstScreenFragments) vs screens 2+ (generateDynamicScreen). Screen 1 uses FIXED_OPENING_QUESTION constant with only fragments returned. Screens 2+ get full DynamicScreenResponse including reflectiveStatement. Both use FragmentInput component. Two batches of 10 affirmations generated sequentially via generateAffirmationBatchFO08.\n2026-01-28 08:06 - Task f59 verified: FO-08 wiring was already complete - page.tsx correctly imports FOExperience from components, layout.tsx uses Fo08LayoutClient with TopSubmenu navigation\n2026-01-28 08:06 - EPIC COMPLETE: Created fo-experience.tsx main flow controller, wired up page and layout.",
