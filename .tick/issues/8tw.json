  "description": "Create the FO-06 discovery agent with a simplified prompt.\n\nFiles to create:\n- `src/mastra/agents/fo-06/agent.ts` - Discovery agent\n\n**Key differences from FO-05:**\n1. Simplified system prompt - no 5 dimensions, just 'understand why user wants affirmations in 2-5 exchanges'\n2. Response format has NO reflectiveStatement field:\n   { question, initialFragments, expandedFragments, readyForAffirmations }\n3. Question should incorporate reflection: 'one sentence reflecting what we know + asking what matters most'\n\nCopy structure from `src/mastra/agents/fo-05/agent.ts` but rewrite the DEFAULT_INSTRUCTIONS to be minimal.\n\nPrompt core:\n```\nYou are conducting a brief investigation (2-5 exchanges) to understand\nwhy this user wants positive affirmations. Your goal is to understand\nthem well enough to create very good, specific affirmations for them.\n\nGenerate a single question that:\n1. Reflects what you've learned so far (in one sentence)\n2. Asks what is most important to understand now\n\nAlso generate sentence-starter fragments to help them respond.\n```\n\n⚠️ Do not close until the agent file is created and exports correctly.",
