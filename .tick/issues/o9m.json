  "notes": "2026-01-24 08:05 - Pre-existing E2E test flakiness: FO-04 test fails at dynamic screen 1 chip selection. The test clicks chips but they don't get added to the input field (visible in debug-fo04-dynamic1-next.png). The chip selector looks for 'button:has-text(\"+ \")' but the verification looks for '.bg-purple-100' which may not match. This is NOT blocking for FO-05 implementation but should be addressed. Build and lint both pass successfully.",
