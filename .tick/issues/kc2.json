  "notes": "2026-02-09 10:34 - FO-10 info page successfully created following FO-09 info page pattern. Navigation registration complete with both Demo and Info routes. Overview page updated with version card and comparison table entry. All files compile successfully.\n2026-02-09 10:41 - E2E test created successfully. Key learnings: (1) Step 4 uses 'Continue' button while steps 5-7 use 'Next' button, (2) Heart animations take ~3s to complete between discovery steps, (3) Fragment mode (step 5) appends text with '...' removal, sentence mode (steps 6-7) replaces text, (4) Chip counts verified: 8 initial + 15 expanded for AI-generated steps, (5) Test structure follows FO-09 pattern with adjustments for fixed 4-question flow and predefined topic chips.",
