  "description": "Implement open text + chips screens with heart animations\n\n## Context\n\n**Spec:** docs/projects/2026-01-23-FO-03/2026-01-23-FO-03-spec.md\n\n**Key files for this epic:**\n- app/fo-03/components/step-topics.tsx - reference chip pattern\n- Framer Motion for animations\n\n**Steps covered:**\n- Step 5: What is going on (situation) - open text + chips + heart animation\n- Step 6: Current feelings - open text + chips + heart animation\n- Step 7: What helps - open text + chips",
  "notes": "2026-01-23 08:27 - TextWithChips component created at app/fo-03/components/text-with-chips.tsx. Props: headline, placeholder, primaryChips, moreChips, value ({text, chips}), onChange, onNotSure, onContinue. Uses AnimatePresence with mode='popLayout' for smooth chip expansion. Continue button disabled when no input (text or chips). Next tasks should wire this into fo-experience.tsx for steps 5-7 with step-specific chip data from the spec.\n2026-01-23 08:28 - HeartAnimation component created at app/fo-03/components/heart-animation.tsx. Props: message (string), onComplete (callback). Features: pulsing heart SVG, fade-in message text, auto-advance after 2.5s or on click. Used between Steps 5-\u003e6 and 6-\u003e7. Messages per spec: Step 5 uses 'You are doing great - the more you write the better affirmations\\!', Step 6 uses 'You have been doing great, {name}\\! We are creating your personalized affirmations.' Next task should wire HeartAnimation into fo-experience.tsx for the step transitions.\n2026-01-23 08:32 - Steps 5-7 now fully wired in fo-experience.tsx. Key implementation detail: showHeartAnimation boolean state controls whether to show TextWithChips or HeartAnimation for steps 5 and 6. On Continue, showHeartAnimation is set to true; when heart animation completes, it resets to false and advances to next step. Step 7 has no heart animation. 'Not sure' skips directly without heart animation. All chip data constants are defined at module level.",
