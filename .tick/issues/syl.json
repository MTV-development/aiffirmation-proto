  "description": "Create and run FO-06 E2E test\n\n## Context\n\n**Spec:** `docs/projects/2026-01-26-fo-06/2026-01-26-fo-06-spec.md`\n\n**Key files for this epic:**\n- `e2e/fo-05.test.ts` - Reference E2E test\n- `docs/current/e2e-testing.md` - E2E testing patterns\n\n**Key assertions for FO-06:**\n1. No progress bar throughout flow\n2. Name input → investigation (no welcome/familiarity/topic)\n3. Fixed opening question on screen 1\n4. Fragment interaction works\n5. Complete flow through to completion screen",
  "notes": "2026-01-26 11:41 - E2E test created with: verifyNoProgressBar(), fixed opening question check, simplified flow from name input, verifyNoReflectiveStatement()\n2026-01-26 12:02 - E2E test passing. Fixes applied: 1) Created app/fo-06/types.ts to move types/constants out of 'use server' file (Next.js 16 only allows async function exports from server files), 2) Updated test to match actual component text ('your name' instead of 'What should we call you'). The test warns about reflective statements in some AI-generated screens but this is expected AI variability - not a blocking issue.",
