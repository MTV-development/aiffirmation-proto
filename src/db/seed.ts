      text: `## AFFIRMATION GENERATION GUIDELINES

1. STRUCTURE
- First-person singular only: I, My.
- Present tense only; no future or past.
- Declarative statements only; no questions or conditionals.
- Positive framing: describe what is, not what is avoided.

Optional growth-form statements when a direct identity claim may sound unrealistic:
- I am learning to…
- I am becoming…
- I am open to…
- I am practicing…

2. SENTENCE OPENERS
Use a variety across outputs:
- "I am…" (35–40%)
- "I + verb…" (30–35%) — trust, choose, allow, honor, welcome
- Growth-form statements (10–15%)
- "My…" (10%)
- "This/The…" (5–10%)
- Other (≤5%)

3. LENGTH
- Target: 5–9 words.
- Acceptable range: 3–14 words.
- Shorter (3–6 words) for identity statements.
- Longer (8–12 words) allowed for nuance or clarity.
- Growth-form statements may be slightly longer.

4. TONE
- Calm, grounded, steady.
- Warm and self-compassionate.
- Confident but never forceful.
- Sincere and authentic; avoid slogans or hype.
- Present and immediate in feel.

5. CONTENT PRINCIPLES
- Believability: avoid grandiose or absolute claims.
- Reinforce agency and inner stability.
- Emotionally safe: never dismissive of struggle.
- Universal applicability unless personalization is provided elsewhere.

6. POWER VERBS
Being: am, deserve, am worthy of
Trust: trust, believe in, rely on
Choice: choose, allow, let, give myself permission
Emotional: welcome, honor, embrace, cherish, nourish
Action: release, let go, steady, rise, hold
Growth: learn, grow, soften, open, become

7. IMAGERY (USE SPARINGLY)
Prefer simple, grounding imagery:
- Natural: rooted, steady, flowing, growing
- Physical: breath, body, ground, heart, hands
Avoid elaborate metaphors, mystical imagery, or multiple images in one sentence.

8. AVOID
- Exclamation marks or excited tone
- Superlatives: best, perfect, unstoppable
- Comparisons to others or past self
- Conditionals: if, when, once
- Negative framing ("not anxious")
- External dependency ("Others see my worth")
- Overreach ("Nothing can stop me")
- Multi-clause or complex sentences
- Religious dogma
- Toxic positivity

9. QUALITY CHECKLIST
A valid affirmation must:
- Read naturally in one breath
- Feel attainable or gently aspirational
- Be emotionally safe
- Emphasize internal agency
- Be universally applicable unless context is provided
- Convey kindness

10. EXAMPLES

Excellent:
- I am enough.
- I trust myself.
- My breath steadies my mind.
- I choose peace.
- I am worthy of love.
- I meet this moment with calm.
- I am learning to be gentle with myself.

Good:
- I honor my needs with care.
- I give myself permission to rest.
- My strength rises quietly within me.
- I welcome this moment as it is.
- I am becoming more patient with my heart.

Avoid:
- I will succeed tomorrow.
- I am not stressed.
- Everyone loves me.
- Nothing can stop me.
- I am better than yesterday.

## Working with Multiple Themes

Since the user has selected {{ themeCount }} themes ({{ themes | join: ", " }}), follow these guidelines:

1. **Distribute Evenly**: Create a roughly equal number of affirmations for each theme. With {{ themeCount }} themes and 10 affirmations, aim for approximately {{ 10 | divided_by: themeCount }} affirmations per theme.

2. **Avoid Forced Combinations**: Do NOT try to artificially combine themes into a single affirmation if the result feels unnatural or contrived. A focused affirmation on one theme is better than a clumsy mashup.

3. **Natural Overlaps Only**: If two themes genuinely have natural synergy (e.g., self-love and relationships, or motivation and work ethic), you may create 1-2 affirmations that naturally bridge them. But only if the combination flows authentically.

4. **Theme Identification**: At the end of each affirmation, do NOT label which theme it belongs to - let the affirmation speak for itself.
